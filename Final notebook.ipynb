    "Its not easy for a majority of tourists to find restaurants that align with their tastes, especially when visiting unfamiliar locations. Lack of personalized recommendations means that they may rely on random reviews, which do not always reflect their preferences or specific dining needs. The lack of tailored suggestions can negatively impact a tourist's overall experience. The problem Savor Space seeks to solve is how to provide accurate and personalized restaurant recommendations based on individual preferences, allowing tourists to easily find eateries they will enjoy."
